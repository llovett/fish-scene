Main program: Scene

My program displays a small school of fish approaching the camera. When the fish
reach a certain closeness, the camera turns around to watch the fish from
behind, and follows the school. The body of each fish is a textured 3D
spline. The side fins are polygons, and the dorsal fin and tail are 2D
splines. I wanted to make the background more detailed (make it look more like
an ocean rather than a solid aqua), but I ran out of time. I might re-submit
when I get more time to make this look really nice. Also, the program runs more
slowly than I'd like, but when I turn on any compiler optimization flags, the
model for my fish bodies explodes. I'm not sure why this is, but it may have
something to do with the say I'm specifying the spline coordinates for fish
bodies. Compiling with the given Makefile should produce a nice-looking program,
though.

I affirm that I adhered to the Honor Code.
